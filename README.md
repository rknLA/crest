crest
======
### A hypermedia-influenced curl CLI ###

Doing for REST APIs what curl did for URLs.


Description
-----------

`crest` is a CLI tool designed for hand-testing RESTful/Hypermedia APIs.  
Its main benefit over tools like [curl](http://curl.haxx.se/) and
[HTTPie](https://github.com/jkbr/httpie) is that `crest` is designed with
more than one request in mind.


Installation
------------
Git clone, gem install, or copypasta or whatever.

Put `crest` somewhere in your path.

Make sure `which crest` gives you something sane.

There it is.  You're done.
